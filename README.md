# My Marlin config

## For **Ender-3pro** with **SKR Mini E3 V2.0** control board & **3DTouch** sensor

Based on this [Reddit guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3/comments/h8y1ia/marlin_20x_guide_skr_mini_e3_v20_ender_3/).

Works fine with [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) v2.0.6.1.

Compiled with VSCode & Platform.io extension with [official guide](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html).

3DTouch sensor attached with [this mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3003725) (3mm-lower version).

*.h files from this repository shall be placed in /Marlin folder, near to Makefile with /lib & /src folders.
